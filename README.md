# Horn!!!

So you keep finding yourself on the wrong scene? People need to get your attention? Use this bot to allow people to type "!horn" into chat and play a sound on your computer. The included sound is that of a car horn but can be swapped at will. There is a cooldown of 30s on the bot at the moment.
